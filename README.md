# Emacs Plugin for Godot 

## uwu Wats dis? >w< uwu
So this is ideally meant to be a plugin that provides some basic Emacs-like keybindings for Godot. I've searched online, and it seems like no-one else has done this, so hey uwuw let's give  it a go!!

## Progress ;_; 
Currently, I've implemented the functionality for a few of the bread-and-butter Emacs operations (beginning-of-line, end-of-line, forward-char, backward-char, end-of-line), but I haven't quite managed to figure out how to override Godot's builtin bindings....
